Welcome to gi7-pa1's GitHub Repository 🚀

Hey, thanks for stopping by! 👋

Been into computers forever. I am addicted since a very long time to making and breaking tech stuff, old or new, and yeah, I occasionally write cool code. 💻 Here’s a few hints about me:

    Skills: Linux, Python, Java, HTML, Bash, Scratch and debugging, and messing with old hardware (— addicted to the last one 🛠️) and lot of other stuff i can't even remember at this point. If it breaks, I’ll fix it... or make it worse.
        
    Math Buff: Math’s my thing 🔢. I enjoy going down weird, obscure paths (like ancient books 📚) even if I don’t always ace the tests.

    Problem Solver: I come up with solutions that might seem odd and unconventional, but they get the job done 💡.

    No Shortcuts: Not into script-kiddies. If I’m using something, I want to understand how it works 🔍.

    AI and Code? Nope: AI’s great for writing essays, but when it comes to writing code, that’s strictly my territory 👨‍💻.

    Home Lab Enthusiast: My lab’s full of old gear 🖥️. It’s sysadmin roleplay with an ancient crap debuff, but it’s fun.

    Lazy, but Focused: Naturally lazy, but I worship selective effort 😴💪.

    Not Cool, Just Me: I try to be cool, but I’m still working on it 😎❌.

    Favorite People/Things: Haters, Appreciators and also genuinely curious people. 🫶.

Over and Out.
