Welcome to gi7-pa1's GitHub Repository ðŸš€

Hey, thanks for stopping by!

Been into computers forever. I have an addiction to making and breaking tech stuff, old or new, and yeah, I occasionally write cool code. Hereâ€™s a bit about me:

    Skills: Linux, Python, Java, HTML, Bash, debugging, and messing with old hardware â€” addicted to the last one. If it breaks, Iâ€™ll fix it... or make it worse.

    Math Buff: Mathâ€™s my thing. I enjoy going down weird, obscure paths (like ancient books) even if I donâ€™t always ace the tests.

    Problem Solver: I come up with solutions that might seem odd and unconventional, but they get the job done.

    No Shortcuts: Not into script-kiddies. If Iâ€™m using something, I want to understand how it works.

    AI and Code? Nope: AIâ€™s great for writing essays, but when it comes to writing code, thatâ€™s strictly my territory.

    Home Lab Enthusiast: My labâ€™s full of old gear. Itâ€™s sysadmin roleplay on easy mode with an ancient crap debuff, but itâ€™s fun.

    Lazy, but Focused: Naturally lazy, but I worship selective effort.

    Not Cool, Just Me: I try to be cool, but Iâ€™m still working on it.

    Favorite People/Things: Haters and Appreciators.
